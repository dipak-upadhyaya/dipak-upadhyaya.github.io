                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am a Ph.D. candidate in Biomedical and Health Informatics at Case Western Reserve University, where I integrate data-driven analytical methods with clinical and public health research. My work focuses on leveraging machine learning, large language models (LLMs), and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to address complex diagnostic and prognostic challenges in healthcare. By aligning advanced computational techniques with clinical expertise, I strive to develop tools that enhance decision-making, improve patient outcomes, and foster greater trust in AI-driven solutions.
                        My research emphasizes interpretability, transparency, and practical impact. In a recent Computers in Biology and Medicine publication, my colleagues and I employed machine learning interpretability methods to evaluate hematologic biomarkers for patients with suspected infections, illustrating how explainable models can guide clinical prognosis. Similarly, an XAI framework I introduced for pediatric ophthalmology, accepted for the AMIA 2025 Informatics Summit, highlights the importance of transparent modeling approaches. I have also explored LLM-inspired techniques and multi-modal data for ophthalmic diagnosis, presented at AIME 2024, and contributed to the MaTiLDA platform, which integrates machine learning and topological data analysis to interpret complex brain networks. Prior to my doctoral studies, I served as a Lecturer in Public Health at Tribhuvan University, conducting research in epidemiology, maternal health, and healthcare utilization. These experiences, coupled with ongoing professional affiliations and interdisciplinary collaborations, underpin my commitment to advancing biomedical informatics and supporting evidence-based, globally relevant healthcare strategies.
